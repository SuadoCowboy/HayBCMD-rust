HayBCMD but in Rust.

Unfortunately/Fortunately, because of the safety of rust,
I can't make much about static functions and stuff, so I'm
making a safe code that only have a single print function
that I could not find a way to make static mutable function thing.

I don't think rust might be a good language to implement this sort of stuff so i believe i'm going back to C++
